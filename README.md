===Hello===
Laughing archer is a project for managing books on your desktop. 

Now, it's kind of a mess. It's a mix of scala and java code. I'm continously learning new libraries and trying to use them.

In final version it will provide functionality to read and process mobipoket files. I'm working on it with PREON.

GUI is written in scalafx.

More details on what I'm doing right now on http://atterothegreatest.github.io/
